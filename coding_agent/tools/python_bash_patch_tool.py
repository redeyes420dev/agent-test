Python/Bash/Patch Tool - Tool for executing Python code, bash commands, and applying patches

PYTHON_TOOL_DESCRIPTION = """This function is used to execute Python code or terminal commands in a stateful Jupyter notebook environment. python will respond with the output of the execution or time out after 60.0 seconds. Internet access for this session is disabled. Do not make external web requests or API calls as they will fail. Just as in a Jupyter notebook, you may also execute terminal commands by calling this function with a terminal command, prefaced with an exclamation mark.

In addition, for the purposes of this task, you can call this function with an `apply_patch` command as input.  `apply_patch` effectively allows you to execute a diff/patch against a file, but the format of the diff specification is unique to this task, so pay careful attention to these instructions. To use the `apply_patch` command, you should pass a message of the following structure as "input":

%%bash
apply_patch <<"EOF"
*** Begin Patch
[YOUR_PATCH]
*** End Patch
EOF

Where [YOUR_PATCH] is the actual content of your patch, specified in the following V4A diff format.

*** [ACTION] File: [path/to/file] -> ACTION can be one of Add, Update, or Delete.
For each snippet of code that needs to be changed, repeat the following:
[context_before] -> See below for further instructions on context.
- [old_code] -> Precede the old code with a minus sign.
+ [new_code] -> Precede the new, replacement code with a plus sign.
[context_after] -> See below for further instructions on context.

For instructions on [context_before] and [context_after]:
- By default, show 3 lines of code immediately above and 3 lines immediately below each change. If a change is within 3 lines of a previous change, do NOT duplicate the first change's [context_after] lines in the second change's [context_before] lines.
- If 3 lines of context is insufficient to uniquely identify the snippet of code within the file, use the @@ operator to indicate the class or function to which the snippet belongs. For instance, we might have:
@@ class BaseClass
[3 lines of pre-context]
- [old_code]
+ [new_code]
[3 lines of post-context]

- If a code block is repeated so many times in a class or function such that even a single @@ statement and 3 lines of context cannot uniquely identify the snippet of code, you can use multiple `@@` statements to jump to the right context. For instance:

@@ class BaseClass
@@ 	def method():
[3 lines of pre-context]
- [old_code]
+ [new_code]
[3 lines of post-context]

Note, then, that we do not use line numbers in this diff format, as the context is enough to uniquely identify code. An example of a message that you might pass as "input" to this function, in order to apply a patch, is shown below.

%%bash
apply_patch <<"EOF"
*** Begin Patch
*** Update File: pygorithm/searching/binary_search.py
@@ class BaseClass
@@     def search():
-        pass
+        raise NotImplementedError()

@@ class Subclass
@@     def search():
-        pass
+        raise NotImplementedError()

*** End Patch
EOF

File references can only be relative, NEVER ABSOLUTE. After the apply_patch command is run, python will always say "Done!", regardless of whether the patch was successfully applied or not. However, you can determine if there are issue and errors by looking at any warnings or logging lines printed BEFORE the "Done!" is output.
